# Common Moves of podcasting: Fiction

I found the podcast form of fiction to be the most interesting, and decided to focus my energies on this genre because of its dynamic inclusion of various podcast elements. I found that between the first episodes of "Homecoming" and "Serial," I was able to compile a substantial list of effective audio elements that both podcasts include. Better yet, I found that both podcasts bear notably different podcasting elements. These contrasting factors add to the general effectiveness and persuasive ability of each unique work.

## Serial

**_Real dialogue reaped from real life sources_**

Serial is effective in its story-telling because of the precursory idea that these scenes have actually happened. Serial paints the pictures of real people and real lives, which gives it its visceral attribute. The biggest component of this is its utilization of speech from interviews with real people. These accounts remind audiences that the stories being spoken are actually real.

**_General narration_**

The narration style in the show is unique because it adds very little tension to the presentation. Instead it is a method of which the authors employ to inform the readers. The narrator is also running the investigation, but when she isn't actively participating in the story as a character, she takes a step back as a narrator. This put the audience at an objective view.

**_Narrator intervention_**

Serial is effective partially because the narrator exists, and acts as a guiding influence to the progression of the show. Whereas Homecoming expects the audience to fill in blanks with inferences or assumptions, Serial does so by including an attentive narrator.

**_Music and tones _**

Music and tones in Serial act similarly as they do in Homecoming. In the case of Serial, They behave to allow for extra knowledge that real tapes of interviews are in fact real. In addition to this, music grants the audience knowledge that certain events are occurring. When they narrator is thinking, cognitive music plays. When the story begins to conclude, this is evident through sounds and song.

## Homecoming

**_Direct dialogue_**

There is not narrator in the story, so the tale is constructed most substantially by the pushes of consistent dialogue. Whatever happens in the progression of the plot, it occurs within a sequence of dialogue, and nowhere else.

**_Clear character defining dynamics _**

Characters in Homecoming come attached with personalities with extra flavor. When you hear characters from the show converse, they don't speak as if they are real people. They speak like actors, and its clear that despite the "real world" setting of the story, that these characters are merely archetypes of common human identities.

**_Music and ambient tones _**

These are critical to the podcast for Homecoming. The setting in which characters reside matters a lot to the story, and the only way to get the point across the characters are "in a diner" or "outside near a park" is by clearly making noises or playing music that indicate the presence of a diner/park.

**_Transition tones_**

The lack of a directed narrator for the show provides another initial barrier. Homecoming has not official way to indicate when it moves on to other topics, and when it remains where it is. The podcast mends this issue by introducing transitional tones to the mix. These tones and sounds change as the setting of the podcast changes. For instance, it displays how the focus shifts from the present, to a memory of a character.
